# Live Collaborative Coding with Technical Questions

In the current CS job market, technical questions are essential. Our platform offers a new way to enhance your skills by enabling collaborative work on technical coding challenges. Designed for real-time interaction, it allows developers to team up and tackle coding problems together, rather than practicing independently. The platform integrates live video for seamless communication and teamwork, facilitating shared problem-solving and debugging. Ideal for interview preparation, coding practice, and collaborative learning, it provides a dynamic and engaging environment to improve your technical abilities effectively.

Users can choose questions of varying difficulty and program in up to 5 different languages (with more options coming soon!). They can write and execute their code directly on our site and view the results for passed and failed test cases.

## Current Functionality
- Real-Time Collaborative Coding: Users can create or join unique rooms to code together in real time, enhancing teamwork and collective problem-solving.
- Code Compilation in Multiple Languages: The platform supports code execution in five different languages, allowing users to compile and run code directly within an integrated terminal.
- Leetcode-Inspired Problem Selection: Users can explore a variety of coding challenges at all difficulty levels, sourced from Leetcode. Each problem includes a detailed statement, time complexity considerations, and example test cases for effective practice.
- Video Feature (In Development): Video functionality is partially implemented but requires further debugging, especially around connection stability.

## To Add In Future
- Peer-to-Peer Video Fixes: Address existing bugs related to peer-to-peer video functionality to improve reliability and user experience.
- Server Deployment with Yjs: Plan for the deployment of servers using Yjs, facilitating collaborative editing beyond local environments and deploy a database of many more Leetcode Problems
- Random Room Matching Algorithm: Implement a random room matching system, allowing users to connect with others without needing to specify room IDs, enhancing the spontaneity of collaboration.
- Dynamic Test Case Generation: Develop scripts for generating dynamic test cases, enabling users to seamlessly test their solutions with a diverse range of inputs. This will address the lack of an official LeetCode API by creating a custom solution.
