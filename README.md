# Live Collaborative Coding with Technical Questions

In the current CS job market, technical questions are essential. Our platform offers a new way to enhance your skills by enabling collaborative work on technical coding challenges. Designed for real-time interaction, it allows developers to team up and tackle coding problems together, rather than practicing independently. The platform integrates live video for seamless communication and teamwork, facilitating shared problem-solving and debugging. Ideal for interview preparation, coding practice, and collaborative learning, it provides a dynamic and engaging environment to improve your technical abilities effectively.

Users can choose questions of varying difficulty and program in up to 5 different languages (with more options coming soon!). They can write and execute their code directly on our site and view the results for passed and failed test cases.
